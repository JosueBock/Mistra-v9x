Purpose: Describe the main updates and bugfix done in Mistra, as compared to the first version distrbuted to Elise Droste in late December 2016 / early January 2017:

   - activity.f: check that xo4 = xo**4 > tiny(0.)
                 plus cosmetic improvements, comments, etc.

   - nuc.f: missing initialisation of nn and nh in SR ternucl

   - kpp.f: bugfix SR initc: xiod was missing (used to initialise iodine concentration in particles)
            updated SR liq_parm: update_now to get all aqueous rates of tot if a bin is activated
	    updated SRs st_coeff_*: implicit none and common factor calculated only once.
	    removed SRs vmean_*: were already no longer used in the first distributed version (automated version developed end 2016)
	    updated SRs henry_*: implicit none, temperature factor calculated only once
            updated SR cw_rc (little inconsistency in .gt. and .lt. tests, plus mostly cosmetic work)
	    updated SR fast_k_mt_*: print error message about the species list only once, at the beginning on one run
	    updated SR equil_co_*: commented rates for HCHO (unused)
	    updated SR kpp_driver: commented initial check sl1 & sion1 >0: at the moment, still in each mech
	    updated SR ionbalance: implicit none
	    updated SR dry_cw_rc: implicit none, cleaned
	    updated SR gasdrydep: potential division by 0 when f0=0 avoided
	    updated functions: fhet_t (implicit none), flsc6, uplim, uplip: handle unexpected [H+] (0 or very small)
	    removed unused function fdhet_a

   - str.f: cleaned multiple print* used for debug
	    added call v_mean_init in restart case (allocate arrays)
	    bugfix SR initm: rho(k) needs xm1(k) but was defined before xm1(k) itself
            changed unit for file profma.out: was unit 6, reserved for stdout. Now: 26
	    updated function vterm
	    updated SR claf, with comments
	    updated SR subkon
	    added SR diff_wat_vap and SR therm_conduct_air (both new -- formerly handled in internal functions)
	    rewritten SR advec (change case u<0, and should be more efficient in case u=0) note also CB59 -> arguments
	    rewritten SR oneD_dist (but still needs improvements; at least, no particles are "lost" now)


TO DO LIST
Rename ACO2, MO2,ROOH, SO4lz
Two step liquid uptake for MSA and MSIA (CH3SO3H and CH3SO2H): keep same henry, add xkef/xkeb
